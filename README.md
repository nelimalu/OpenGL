# OpenGL
my journey to learn OpenGL and GPU graphics

## how to run
to run OpenGL programs, you need to have a c++ compiler as well as the GLEW and GLFW libraries.
i'm working on these projects using the sublime text editor, and mingw to compile through command prompt.

make sure that you have mingw installed and added to path

a customized run command can be found in RUN.bat, but it would need to be customized depending on where your SDL files are located

## future projects
- cool screensaver
- ant slime simulation
- something 3D
